Split your code into as many files as needed, organized into any directory structure style you wish, and let Angular Builder do the *Grunt* work for you ;-), while you concentrate on writing actual useful code!\n\n\n### Features\n\nAngular Builder brings you much more than source code /assets loading.\n\nRead the [Features](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki/Features) page to get a better understanding of what Angular Builder can do for you.\n\n### Show your support\n\nIf you use Angular-Builder, please [star](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder) the project on Github to show your support!\n\nAnd **spread the word!**\n\nA lot of people don't know about Angular Builder yet!  \nThey'll surely thank you if you show them a way to make their lives easier when developing AngularJS applications! ;-)\n\n# Documentation\n\nExtended documentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki).\n\nYou can also examine the tests that are provided on the `/tests` folder and the test configurations that are defined on `/Gruntfile.js`. They are very simple working examples that you can build immediately.\n\n##### Extending Angular Builder\n\nIf you would like to develop Angular Builder extensions (middleware), you can build reference documentation for the builder's classes and functions by running (on the project's folder):\n\n\tgrunt doc\n\nThen open `doc/index.html`.\n\n## Before we start\nYou should know [about angular-builder's limitations](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki/Limitations).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n> This plugin is available for installation from **npm**.\n\n>**Do not donwload the source code from the git repository into your project**, for you could end up using a (possibly) very unstable development version and **not a stable release**.\n\nStart by installing Grunt `~0.4.1` on your project.\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.\n\nOnce you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-angular-builder --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-angular-builder');\n```\n\n## The \"angular-builder\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `angular-builder` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  'angular-builder': {\n    options: {\n      // Task-specific options go here.\n    },\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThe available options are explained in the [Configuring tasks](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki/Configuring-tasks) page.\n\n### Basic Use\n\nThis is the minimal recommended `Gruntfile.js`.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (grunt)\n{\n  grunt.initConfig ({\n\n    'angular-builder': {\n      options: {\n        mainModule: 'mainModuleName'\n      },\n      app: {\n        src:  'src/**/*.js',\n        dest: 'build/project.js'\n      }\n    }\n\n  });\n  \n  grunt.loadNpmTasks ('grunt-angular-builder');\n  \n  grunt.registerTask ('release', ['angular-builder']);\n  grunt.registerTask ('debug', ['angular-builder::debug']);\n\n};\n```\n\n### Running tasks\n\nTo run the above task:\n\n- For a releast build, type `grunt angular-builder` on the command line;\n- For a debug build, type either:\n    - `grunt angular-builder::debug`, or\n    - `grunt angular-builder --build=debug`.\n\nIf you define your own alias tasks with more complex build steps, run `grunt your-task-name` instead.\n\n> Tip: you can use the `--build=debug` option to convert any task alias into a _debug_ build (assuming it includes an angular-builder subtask).\n\n### The recommended tasks alias\n\nThe example above includes two alias tasks registered at the bottom. These tasks are customisable shortcuts to your build process. They are a starting point for you to expand with additional subtasks provided by other Grunt plugins.\n\nTo assemble a release build of your project, run the command:\n`grunt release`\n\nFor a debug build, run the command:\n`grunt debug`\n\n> These alias are just a suggestion. You may configure your Grunt tasks in any way you want.\n\n### Integrating with other Grunt tasks\n\n_Build-directives_ embedded in your source javascript files can direct the builder to generate lists of stylesheets and templates that are **actually** required by your modules, in the correct loading order. These file path arrays can then be used by other Grunt tasks to build the required files.  \nRead the [Wiki](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki) for more information.\n\n##### If you wish to minify/optimize your build files\n\nYou can add the respective tasks to the `release` task list, __after__ the `angular-builder` task.\n\n##### If you wish to compile files from other languages to javascript (coffeescript, typescript, etc)\n\nThey must be compiled prior to the build step, so you should add those tasks to the `release` task list __before__ the `angular-builder` task.\n\n### Advanced Use\n\nRead the [Configuration examples](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/wiki/Configuration-examples) page for additional information and examples.\n\n### Debugging build failures\n\nThe build tool will display extended information when warnings or errors occur during the build process if you run the `grunt` command with the `-v` option.\n\nYou may also force Grunt to ignore some warnings and continue building by running `grunt` with the `--force` option (not recommended, though).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal style-guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\n\nA linter is already present on the project, so just type `grunt` to run it.\n\nIf it's appropriate, create some test cases on the `/tests` folder and include them as individual tasks on the project's Gruntfile.\n\nAlways start developing by creating a topic branch on your forked repository from the latest tagged stable version on the `master` branch.\n\nWhen your work is ready, submit a pull request.\n\n__Important:__ all contributions that are accepted will be made available under the project's license.\n\n## Release History\n\n[v1.0.0-beta2](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta2) / 2014-09-23\n\n- Bug fix.\n\n[v1.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta1) / 2014-08-06\n\n- Getting ready for the official release.\n\n[v0.5.2](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v0.5.2) / 2014-08-04\n\n- Bug fixes.\n\n[v0.5.1](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v0.5.1) / 2014-07-21\n\n- Documentation update.\n\n[v0.5.0](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v0.5.0) / 2014-07-15\n\n- Major internal refactoring; middleware-based architecture.\n- Adds support for setting the main module's dependencies via configuration options, which simplifies the building of large, modular applications.\n- New configuration options.\n\n[v0.4.5](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v0.4.5) / 2014-06-12\n\n- Hotfix release.\n\n[v0.4.4](https://github.com/claudio-silva/grunt-angular-builder/releases/tag/v0.4.4) / 2014-06-12\n\n- Support for non-angular-module scripts inclusion and dependency resolution.
